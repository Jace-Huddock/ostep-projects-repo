# ICS-462: Project: Unix Utilities - Assignment 1
Jace Huddock - Bl1248em@go.minnstate.edu

This project includes the files wcat.c, wgrep.c, wzip.c and wunzip.c, and a Makefile as well as this README.

All files except for wzip.c pass all tests. wzip.c passes the first test and fails on 2.out. 


sources I used to complete this project include:

the linux man pages,
and 
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Simple-Makefile.html for the makefile.
